# NFL Quarterback Contract Prediction

In this project, I analyzed NFL quarterback performance using machine learning techniques to predict second contract outcomes as well as the relative contract value based on early career statistics. 

## Project Objective
Through this project, I examined whether passing statistics from a quarterback's first four NFL seasons can predict second contract likelihood and relative contract value. 

## Approach
Using two datasets containing performance statistics and contract information, I cleaned the data, performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, and trained three supervised models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines). Model performance and feature importance were used to evaluate the predictions and interpret results.
