# NFL Quarterback Contract Prediction

In this project, I analyzed NFL quarterback performance using machine learning techniques to predict second contract outcomes and relative contract value based on early career statistics. 

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to determine whether a quarterback's cumulative performance over their first four NFL seasons can predict the likelihood of receiving a second contract and the value of that contract relative to the market. 

## Approach
Using two datasets containing performance statistics and contracts information, I cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, and trained three supervised models (Logistic regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines). Model performance and feature importance were used to evaluate the predictions and interpret results.
